# RockPaperScissors
This is a rock paper scissors game build using Java Spring Boot v2.5.4. Java Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier. The framework provides an embedded tomcat, which will be used to make the requests on its default port 8080. 
The game can be played via command line, however, using Postman will make the experience better.
